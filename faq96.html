<H2>Band Name Origins</H2>

<UL><LI>Joy Division<UL><LI>
They chose Joy Division, the name coming from a lurid 
novel of sado-masochism in German concentration camps
entitled <I>The House of Dolls</I>.  The book also
contributed a (somewhat censored) verse for the song
"No Love Lost".  The "joy divisions" were those which
housed prostitutes and women kept alive for the
pleasure of the officers of the camps.  The irony, if
not the political implication, was obvious.
</LI></UL></LI></UL>


<UL><LI>New Order<UL><LI>
...the band's official story is that Rob Gretton had
spotted a news article in the daily paper which spoke
of the "The people's New Order of Kampuchea", taken from
from a piece in the UK paper, The Guardian (according to
Select 9/93), and the phrase "new order" caught his attention.
The reality may be a mixture of this and the following
(from NME, 28 Feb 81).  The name New Order, which was obviously
appropriate considering the circumstances, had been
used before.  As was pointed out earlier, the band
were great Iggy Pop and the Stooges fans, and after
guitarist Ron Asheton left the group he formed, in
Los Angeles in 1975, a band called The New Order
whose 1977 album sleeve contained a lot of Nazi
paraphernalia.  It is unlikely to the point of
improbability that Joy Division were unaware of 
both the group and their album.
<BR><BR>
Though other names were put forth as possibilities
(many as jokes: "Stevie and the JDs" [Morris was
handling much of the vocals on the demo work - mike],
"Sunshine Valley Dance Band", "The Eternal", etc.),
the band kept returning to New Order.  They realised
that they would immediately be taken to task again 
as "Nazis", but decided that they liked the name and
that was the only consideration...
<BR><BR>
<small>The Sunshine Valley Dance Band was a band that Steve used to be in before he
joined Joy Division. It was basically him and a few school friends.  I doubt
the name was used as a replacement for Joy Division.</small>

<a name=code></a>
<H2>What do the colour codes on PC&L, BM and Confusion stand for?</H2>

<center>
<P><IMG SRC=images/colwhl.gif></P>
</center>

<P> Peter Saville designed a colour code for use on several releases
circa-83. The decoder is the <I>wheel</I> design on the reverse of the
cover to <I>Power, Corruption and Lies</I>. To clear things up a little,
the colour wheel describes the meaning of the coloured squares on
(not only) <I>Power Corruption & Lies</I>, (but also) <I>Blue Monday</I> and
<I>Confusion</I>.</p>

<P>To decode the wheel, use only the outer two rings. You could divide the outer
two rings into full colour, various on green, and various on yellow. The inner
segments appear to be meaningless. Start with the full colour sections, the
first of which will be the green one... This is 'A'. Work your way clockwise
naming each colour the next letter. There are exactly 26 segments around the
disc. From 'Z' work back into the full colours, the first of which is '1'. This
means that the full green segment is either 'A' or '1', and the colour for 'I'
is also that for '9'.</P>

<P>You should be able to decode the squares now. Start with the 5 on the front of
Power Corruption & Lies, and you will find (if you have the vinyl) that the
first 4 squares spell 'FACT' then next square is divided into two, with the
lower half being '7' and the upper half being '5'. Therefore the code is
'FACT 75' which is the Factory number for this release. The code for the CD
front cover is 'FACD 75'.</p>

<P>Other codes for the various items having the coloured squares are:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Inner cover PC&L: <I>Power Corruption And Lies New Order</I></LI>
<LI>Blue Monday 12" Sleeve: <I>FAC 73 Blue Monday And The Beach New Order</I></LI>
<LI>Confusion Outer Sleeve: <I>FAC 93</I></LI>
<LI><I>See if you can guess the code at the top of this document!!!</I></LI>

<a name=barn></a>
<H2>What names has Bernard Sumner gone under?</H2>

<P>Bernard was born Bernard Dicken, but has used several surnames.  Here is a
list of names he has appeared under:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Bernard Dicken</LI>
<LI>Bernard Sumner</LI>
<LI>Bernard Albrecht</LI>
</UL>
<P>Bernard never knew who his father was, so he grew up with his mother and 
grandparents in Salford.  He originally used his mothers surname Sumner, 
but when she married, he changed it with her to Dicken.  Later on, he
changed it to Albrecht, and then changed it back to Sumner.  When asked
about the name  changes, Bernard has said that it's "A story in itself.
I don't talk about stuff that is private to me." (Select 9/93).  Bernard is
known by the rest of the band as <I>Barney</I>.</P>

<P><SMALL>The name Barney Rubble has been mentioned on bootleg material, so it is 
likely that the bootleggers did not know Bernard's surname, or it's a pisstake...
</small></P>

<HR>
<a name=haci></a>
<H2>What is the Hacienda and Dry 201?</H2>

<P>The Hacienda is a nightclub in Manchester (11-13 Whitworth Street West)
that was set up with funds by Factory Records and New Order.
The Factory number for the night-club is FAC 51 (The complete name
for the club is FAC 51 THE HACIENDA). The Hacienda was set up
originally to be like the old club <I>The Factory</I> where local bands
would play live gigs.  However, for the first 7-8 years, the club
was not that successful.  When the club was in financial problems,
the band would either put money in, or play concerts there.  By 1988,
the club became successful with DJs like Greame Park and Mike
Pickering (now part of M-People) spinning the latest acid house
records.  The club soon became "the popular club in Britain".  The
club had to temporarily close in 1990 due to gangland violence (a
bouncer was shot there) but reopened a few months later.  The
popularity of the club has decreased a bit, although some of
it's specialist nights (notably the gay night "Flesh") are still
very successful.  New Order are still on the board of directors for
the Hacienda, although they have said that they wish they weren't.</P>

<P>Dry 201 (Oldham Street) is a bar that New Order and Factory purchased.
The Factory number for it is FAC 201.  Dry 201 was considered to be
the "trendy" bar in Manchester, with it once being described as
"THE place to go before going to the Hacienda".</P>

<P>It is unlikely that you would see New Order regularly at either
Dry or the Hacienda, although if they are found anywhere enjoying
the night-life, then it is likely that they will be at one of these
places.</P>

<HR>
<a name=perf></a>
<H2>What is said between <I>Perfect Kiss</I> and the beginning of <I>This Time of
Night</I> on <I>Low Life</I></H2>

<P>Well, if you turn the volume up enough, you should hear:</P>

<P><I>I'm one of the few people who lives what's called a low life</I></P>
<P>The sample was taken from Jeffrey Bernard, a columnist for the UK magazine 
<I>The Spectator</I>.  However, Jeffrey tried to sue, and the sample was removed - 
or rather recorded over, which is why if you turn the volume up, you can 
just about hear it (especially on CD).</P>

<HR>
<a name=happ></A>
<H2>What is the song <I>The Happy One</I>?</H2>

<P>The song was originally recorded during the sessions in Ibiza for
Technique.  Although Tony Wilson and Rob Gretton, liked the song,
the band didn't like it, so it was never put on Technique, although
it appears in segments on the <I>Substance</i> video.  However,
after Technique was released, Peter Hook appeared on a late night TV
programme called <I>The Other Side Of Midnight</I> (presented and
produced by Tony Wilson), and played this song with a large number
of sequencers and computers (the rest of band couldn't be bothered
to turn up).  This is the only public performance of the song
<I>The Happy One</I> and has appeared on a number of bootleg records.
Some bootlegs are rumoured to exist with the studio verson of the
song, that contains lyrics.</P>
<P>The Happy One was also used for about a year on the BBC1 radio show under
the same name with John Peel.</P>
<P>Also, a Factory promo CD (FAC 303) made as a promo for the French
release of <I>Palatine</I>, titled <I>Palatine Lane</I>, included
several <I>Intermede Musical</I> tracks which were excerpts from
The Happy One. See the <A HREF="facuk2.html">2nd part
of the Factory Discography</A> for more details.</P>

<HR>
<A name=thie></A>
<H2>Do the numbers on the cover of Thieves Likes Us mean anything?</H2>

<P>No - they were taken from a board-game on a painted table in Blair
Castle.  Peter Saville found the picture from a magazine called
<I>Country Life</I>.  There is no number seven, and TLU was the 7th
single - this was accidental.</P>

<HR>
<a name=groo></A>
<H2>Groove Notations</H2>

<P>The following is a list of "groove" notations for 7"/12" vinyl NO
releases. These are message scratched into the vinyl matrix of the records,
along with matrix numbers and pressing details.</P>
<P>A common message is <I>A Porky Prime Cut!</I>. 
Porky Prime Cut : He is/was George Peckham, who does the mastering at (I
think) EMI, he allegedly only puts this message on records he likes -
it's just not the same with CD's is it? [Thanks to Nick Dillon for that]</p>

<H2>Is there a "True Faith" CD single with remixes available?</H2>

<P>Yes, a UK "True Faith" CDV (CD Video) and a US CD promo exist that have
mixes of the track on them.  Here is the pertinent information:</P>
<PRE>
   CD5:	US 1987	(Qwest PRO-CD-2899) [promo]
	4:04	True Faith (the morning sun remix/edit)
	4:10	True Faith (album edit)
	8:59	True Faith (the morning sun extended remix)

   CDV:	UK 1989	(Factory FACDV 183) [PAL]
	8:59	True Faith (remix)
	3:44	Evil Dust
	4:04	True Faith (7" remix edit)
		True Faith (video)
</PRE>
<P>Note that "True Faith" (remix) and "True Faith" (the morning sun extended
remix) are in fact the same track.</P>
<P>Also, this is in addition to the 1994 remixes, and the 1995 release
of <I>Nineteen63</I>, of which a limited boxed version had one of the '87 mixes
on it. See the <A HREF="http://www.niagara.edu/New_Order/neworder">New Order Discography</A> for more information.</P>

<H2>Ceremony single clarification</H2>
<P>Several instances of <I>Ceremony</I> were released back in 1981. 2
versions were recorded, the original without Gillian, and then a re-
recording with Gillian. The latter appears on the <I>Substance</I>
compilation. The original is yet to appear on CD. I'll try
and get the recording details by the next version of this FAQ.</P>
<P>Here is a discography excerpt which should be clear:</P>

Stephen Morris

|  Comments: (General) As New Order, the first thing we had was a home-made
|            Transcendent 2000 and a Transcendent sequencer on which we
|            managed to triple the memory by piggy-backing some RAM. That
|            was 1979, before MIDI was invented. The first drum machine
|            we had was a Boss Dr. Rhythm. It was all plugging little mini 
|            jacks into mini jacks. It was all CV and gate.
|
|            When I eventually got a drum synthesizer and it made that 
|            'boo boo' noise, you can imagine my disappointment. ...
|            With Joy Division, there's a sound on Atrocity Exhibition
|            that sounds like feedback guitar with a pig being slaughtered
|            in the background - that's this tiny little drum synthesizer
|            put through a fuzz pedal. We also got the Oberheim DMX
|            and the Prophet V.
|
|            Playing live was a big problem. ... You'd turn it on, and 
|            more often than not, you'd just get rubbish out of it.
|            Our solution to this was to buy two or three of everything. 
|            In the case of the Prophets, we ended up at one particular
|            gig with five and we could only get one of those to work.
|
|            We started with the Emulator Is - the IIs and the Emulator
|            III are still in there. The only way you could get those
|            things working half the time was by whacking them with an
|            iron bar.
|
|            (Blue Monday) Moog Source and a bit of Prophet.
|            I think a lot of it was down to the nice little accidents, like
|            the knob-twiddling and Gillian starting the sequencer off in the
|            wrong place. None of those things really happen any more. Like
|            when you're editing a synth now, you've got to know exactly what
|            you want and how to do it. If you want to make it wobble a bit 
|            more you've got to know which parameters to tweak.

Gillian Gilbert

|  Comments: (General) We'd have this huge sheet of paper and
|            every little tick on it was a clock step. But when we
|            loaded tapes and the data wasn't there, we just
|            wouldn't believe it.
|
|            The Prophets were already unreliable, so when
|            the sequencers started getting that way as well,
|            everything got wiped. The Prophet was wonky and
|            playing out of tune and the sequencer wouldn't play back
|            anything at all.
|            
|            (Blue Monday) We tried to update it when we did the '88
|            version but the new equipment couldn't improve on it.
|            You never knew why things wobbled then, but now you've got to
|            find out why and go into it more.

[side note: Martin Hannet used ARP OMNI 12 through Bernards fx on the
Closer Album]
