<H1>Factory Fans Mailing List</H1>
<HR>

<P>To fans of:</P>

<P>Factory, Factory Too, Factory Benelux, associated
labels, and of course the myriad bands who record
or who have recorded for the great label/s.</P>

<P>E.g A Certain Ratio, Happy Mondays, New Order, 
Durutti Column, Section 25, Stockholm Monsters, 
Railway Children, Joy Division etc etc.</P>

<P>Finally! The new Factory mailing list is again available.
Its a majordomo-based mailing list, so I will ask you to 
subscribe yourself rather than assume anything. Unfortunately
there is no digest version, but I think the volume of
postings will be sporadic enough to not worry.</P>

<P>Anyway: send an email to <A HREF="mailto:majordomo@ausoug.org">majordomo@ausoug.org</A> with the
following in the body of the email:<BR><BR>

<PRE>subscribe factory</PRE></P>

<P>You will receive confirmation shortly afterwards.
To unsubscribe, follow the above tasks but use 'unsubscribe'
instead of 'subscribe'.</P>

<P>To post a message to the list, send email to:<BR>
<A HREF="mailto:factory@ausoug.org">factory@ausoug.org</A></P>

<P>Please follow standard netiquette rules of thumb when
posting (keep your sigs down, don't overquote, and
don't spam).</P>

Any comments or problems, send mail to me, Dennis Remmer
at <A HREF="mailto:dennisremmer@yahoo.com.au">dennisremmer AT yahoo.com.au</A></P>

<P>So there it is! Send a welcome message after 
you subscribe.</P>
